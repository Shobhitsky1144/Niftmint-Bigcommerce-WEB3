                  Welcome to The Niftmint (“Niftmint,” “we,” “us”, or “our”).
                  These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use
                  of the Niftmint website(s) and any other software, tools,
                  features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with
                  our services; including without limitation using our services
                  to view and transfer NFTs and use our tools, at your own
                  discretion, to connect directly with others to view and
                  transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the
                  “Service”). “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or
                  similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the
                  Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or
                  otherwise be associated with certain content or data.
                </p>

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means
                  you as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on
                  behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you
                  and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you
                  are an authorized representative of the entity with the
                  authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree
                  to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.{" "}

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO
                  BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED
                  HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU
                  MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.{" "}

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  Niftmint is not an exchange, broker, financial institution, or
                  creditor. Niftmint provides a web3 service that helps users
                  view, claim, and transfer NFTs available on public
                  blockchains. Niftmint is not party to any agreement between
                  any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the
                  identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFT transfers using
                  the Service and we make no claims about the identity,
                  legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of where you
                  transfer your NFTs to.
                </p>

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes
                  need to provide additional terms for specific services (and
                  such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and
                  shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms
                  and conditions, which are available with the relevant service,
                  then become part of your agreement with us if you use those
                  services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and
                  any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
                  service, such additional terms shall control for that specific
                  service.
                </p>

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  Niftmint reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at
                  any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material
                  changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to
                  provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice
                  through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the
                  beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the
                  Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and
                  all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective
                  as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole
                  responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view
                  such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and
                  conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.

                  Like much of web3, there may be external blockchain address
                  considerations you may need to take into account. Your account
                  on the service (“Account”) will be associated with your
                  blockchain address; however, if you want to add additional
                  information to your Niftmint account,, you can add additional
                  information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  Your Account on Niftmint will be associated with your email
                  address and display the NFTs for that email address (and, if
                  applicable, any content associated with such NFTs).

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  By using your own personal blockchain wallet in connection

                  under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of
                  the wallet. External wallets are not operated by, maintained
                  by, or affiliated with Niftmint, and Niftmint does not have
                  custody or control over the contents of these wallets and has
                  no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Niftmint
                  accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in
                  connection with your use of a wallet and makes no
                  representations or warranties regarding how the Service will
                  operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible
                  for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your
                  private wallet credentials with anyone. If you discover an
                  issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet
                  provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your
                  Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for
                  any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account
                  or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised.
                  You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or
                  otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Service
                  or your Account.

                <p className="pt-3 ">
                  You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all
                  applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws)
                  when using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by
                  using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are
                  not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
                  embargo; and (b) you have not been identified as a Specially
                  Designated National or placed on any U.S. Government list of
                  prohibited, sanctioned, or restricted parties. If you access
                  or use the Service outside the United States, you are solely
                  responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the
                  Service in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not
                  violate any applicable laws.

                  Niftmint may require you to provide additional information and

                  any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation
                  dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these
                  Terms. In such cases, Niftmint, in its sole discretion, may
                  disable your Account and block your ability to access the
                  Service until such additional information and documents are
                  processed by Niftmint. If you do not provide complete and

                  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                  incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation
                  or exclusion may not apply to you.
